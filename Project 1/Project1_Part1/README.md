Project: Project 1 Part 1

The simulink file is titled "P1_pt1.slx"
The matlab file is titled "P1P1.m"

Download the project folder titled "Project1_Part1" and make that folder the new directory in MATLAB.

By opening these files simultaneously and hitting run on the MATLAB script, the script and Simulink file will output 4 figures.

For the plottings, figure 1: W with "ode1", figure 2: W with "ode4", figure 3: W_DOT with "ode1", figure 4: W_DOT with "ode4"
- Each of the following figures contain all 3 time steps. -
- There is an extra figure pop-up labeled figure 5 that should be ignored. 

## Week 1 Feedback (5/5):
Great job! Keep it up for week 2, you're on the right track! The one thing I want to say is to consider adding some sort of logic (either in MATLAB script or Simulink model) to determine whether the applied torque is constant or sinusoidal as this will change inputs to determine applied torque.
