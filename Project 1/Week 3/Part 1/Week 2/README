Running instructions:

Download all contents of the folder labeled Part 1/Week 2 and set the directory accordingly. Our code runs on one MATLAB script and two simulink models.
Open all of the simulink files (P1_pt1_1.slx, P1_pt1_1_Variable.slx) and then run the code from the MATLAB script (Part_1_Final.m).
