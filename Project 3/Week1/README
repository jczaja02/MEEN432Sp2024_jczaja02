For week 1, the team utilized initializing files as initial conditions to simulate a longitudinal vehicle model that is connected to a chasis and wheel model in SIMULINK. There are 3 MATLAB codes and 1 Simulink model included in this week's deliverables. The 'init' file includes initial values for canstans that are found in the simulink model p3_w1_car.slx. Some constants are vehicle mass, wheelbase, center of gravity height. Additionally, there is a torque converter for the inertia values.
The file 'initDriverCycle' is a code with purely numbers that represent the velicity of the vehicle that will be used in the simulation file.
In 'p3_runsim', the DriveData from 'initDriveCycle' is used to plot a time vs velocity figure with a +- 3 boundary lines to ensure the velocity remains within a +- 3 mph uncertainty range. In the plot, there are 2 main lines that is the simulated velocity and the drive cycle velocity for comparison of both data sets.
The 'p3_w1_car.slx' contains all the neccesary models such as drive schedule, simple driver, power train, braking, wheel, and vehicle submodels that utilize the initial constants and outputs to create the necessary plots of velocity, distance, acceleration, and braking plots via scope blocks. Proportional values and Intergrating values were changed to 0.45 and 0.35 respectively to ensure both simulations wouldn't cross the +-3 boundaries and reduce error throughout the entirety of the simulation.
