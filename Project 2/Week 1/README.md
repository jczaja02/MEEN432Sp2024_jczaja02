This code creates a racetrack as one continuous line that has 2 straightaways of 900m and the curves have a radius of 200m, with the width of the track being 15m. Addiionally, the MATLAB code simulates a rectandular car that has dimensions relating to the track. The car will follow the tracks path, pointing in the direction of the heading. The car will rotate according to the cars tangential direction at every coordinate of the simulation.
Below are the instructions to properly execute this code.

Instructions:
1. Firstly, download the MATLAB file named "Racettrack"
2. Upon downloading, open up MATLAB
3. Click "run" button on ribbon
4. For better vizualization, put MATLAB in full screen
5. Enjoy
The code should produce the racetrack in the color blue. Once the car starts begins its journey, it will leave a magenta colored path indicating where it has already traveled. The car will continue to follow the path throughout the circuit while maintaining a proper alignment in orientation. 

## Week 1 Feedback (5/5)
Good job Team 27! For Week 2, start developing a lateral dynamic model of a vehicle that contains subsystems that are listed in the Week 2 document.
