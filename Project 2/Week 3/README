For week 3, the team was tasked to simulate a race car around a track with a statistics output that tracked the number of loops, time to complete loop, and if the car went off track. The first thing was to get our "Project2Week2Simulink" model to create a scatter plot that represents the racetrack. We did this by adding some loops on the simple driver block to fit the parameters of the racetrack. We also included a Proportional-Integrator-Derivative (PID) controller in the driver to get our desired outputs. In our "init" file we added code that would get data for coordinates and plot them into our animation from week 1. 
Instructions: Download "init", "raceStat", and "Project2Week2Simulink.slx" files. Open up all files and run the "init" file. All other files are called for so there shouldn't be a need to run them separately. Make sure the simulink file's that you download is the exact same as the one being called in the "init" file. When you run, there will be a figure pop-up with a dark red background, a gray track, and a blue car that goes around the track leaving a magenta trail behind it. The car will complete 1 loop at 10 m/s. The "raceStat" output will be in the command window with the amount of loops completed, time, and if it left the track.
In regards to peer collaboration, we all meet together multiple times a week to work on the project at the same time. This is the way the team has and will continue to operate during the rest of the semester. With this type of work style, there is no need to upload separate MATLAB files. If this method isn't allowed, please let us know in the next feedback comments for this project.
